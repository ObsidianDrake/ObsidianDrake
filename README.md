- 👋 Hi, I’m @ObsidianDrake
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as I can in analytics. I want to change career paths and break into a field I have become extremely passionate about these last few years. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and working through the Google Professional Advanced Data Analytics Course. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything. I want to begin working with others to learn the potential in analytics. 
- 📫 How to reach me through here, or my linked Kaggle account. This also has a link to my LinkedIn profile.
